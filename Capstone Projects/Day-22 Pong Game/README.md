# 🏓 Pong Game

A Python implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library!

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that allows you to play the classic Pong game. The game is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Turtle graphics library.

### Example:
```
The script sets up a Pong game where two players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The game ends when a player reaches a score of 10.
```

## 📦 Features

- Two-player Pong game
- Simple controls for both players
- Score tracking and game over screen

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - for implementing the logic
- **Turtle** - for graphics

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.py` - The main file to run the Pong game
- `paddle.py` - Contains the `Paddle` class
- `ball.py` - Contains the `Ball` class
- `scoreboard.py` - Contains the `Scoreboard` class

## 💡 Ideas for Improvement

- Add sound effects for paddle hits and scoring.
- Implement a single-player mode with AI control for one paddle.
- Add different difficulty levels.
