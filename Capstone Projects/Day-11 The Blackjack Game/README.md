# 🃏 Blackjack Game

A fun and interactive Blackjack game written in Python as part of my 100 days of Python journey.

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that simulates a game of Blackjack. The player competes against the computer, aiming to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

### Example:
```
Welcome to Blackjack!
Your cards:
 _____
|A    |
|  ♠  |
|____A|

 _____
|8    |
|  ♠  |
|____8|

Your current score: 19
Computer's first card:
 _____
|J    |
|  ♠  |
|____J|

Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: n
Your final hand:
 _____
|A    |
|  ♠  |
|____A|

 _____
|8    |
|  ♠  |
|____8|

Your final score: 19
Computer's final hand:
 _____
|J    |
|  ♠  |
|____J|

 _____
|4    |
|  ♠  |
|____4|

Computer's final score: 14
You win!
```
