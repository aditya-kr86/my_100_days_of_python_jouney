# 📚 Flash Card App

A fun and educational Flash Card App written in Python.

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that helps users learn new words using flash cards. The app displays a word in French and after a few seconds, flips to show the English translation. Users can mark words they have learned, and the app will save the progress.

### Example:
```
The app displays a word in French:
- French: "Bonjour"
After a few seconds, it flips to show the English translation:
- English: "Hello"
Users can then mark if they know the word or not.
```
