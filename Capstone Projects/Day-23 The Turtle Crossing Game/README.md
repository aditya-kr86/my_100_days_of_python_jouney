# Day-23: The Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game, a fun and interactive game developed in Python as part of my 100 days of Python journey.

## Project Description

The Turtle Crossing Game is inspired by the classic Frogger game. The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars to reach the safety of the other side. The game gets progressively harder as the speed of the cars increases.

## Features

- Player controls a turtle to move up, down, left, and right.
- Cars move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds.
- Game difficulty increases as the player advances.
- Collision detection to restart the game if the turtle is hit by a car.
- Obstacles to avoid and power-ups to collect.
- Sound effects for collisions, level-ups, and power-ups.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aditya-kr86/my_100_days_of_python_jouney.git
   cd my_100_days_of_python_jouney
   git sparse-checkout set "Capstone Projects/Day-23 The Turtle Crossing Game"
   ```
2. Navigate to the Capstone Projects directory:
   ```bash
   cd Capstone\ Projects/
   ```
3. Navigate to the Day-23 The Turtle Crossing Game directory:
   ```bash
   cd Day-23\ The\ Turtle\ Crossing\ Game/
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Use the arrow keys to move the turtle:
    - Up arrow key to move up.
    - Left arrow key to move left.
    - Right arrow key to move right.
3. Avoid the cars and obstacles and collect power-ups.
4. Reach the other side to level up. The game will get harder with each level.
5. If hit by a car or an obstacle, the game will restart.
