# ☕ Coffee Machine

A Python script to simulate a coffee machine that serves espresso, latte, and cappuccino!

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that simulates a coffee machine. The script allows users to select a type of coffee, enter coins for payment, and get their coffee if enough resources and payment are provided.

### Example:
```
The script prompts you to choose a coffee type (espresso, latte, or cappuccino), checks if there are enough resources, asks for coin input, and serves the coffee if everything is sufficient.
```
