# 🎲 Number Guessing Game

A Python script for a fun and interactive number guessing game!

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that allows you to play a number guessing game. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.

### Example:
```
The script prompts you to guess a number between 1 and 100. Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you get either 10 (easy) or 5 (hard) attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback if your guess is too high or too low.
```
