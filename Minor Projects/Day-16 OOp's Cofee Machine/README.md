# ‚òï OOP's Coffee Machine

A Python script to simulate a coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles!

## üìú Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that simulates a coffee machine using OOP principles. The script allows users to select a type of coffee, enter coins for payment, and get their coffee if enough resources and payment are provided.

### Example:
```
The script prompts you to choose a coffee type (espresso, latte, or cappuccino), checks if there are enough resources, asks for coin input, and serves the coffee if everything is sufficient.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### How to Run

#### On Linux:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aditya-kr86/my_100_days_of_python_jouney.git
   cd my_100_days_of_python_jouney
   git sparse-checkout set "Minor Projects/Day-16 OOp's Cofee Machine"
   ```
2. Navigate to the Minor Projects directory:
   ```bash
   cd Minor\ Projects/
   ```
3. Navigate to the Day-16 OOp's Cofee Machine directory:
   ```bash
   cd Day-16\ OOp\'s\ Cofee\ Machine/
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

#### On Windows:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aditya-kr86/my_100_days_of_python_jouney.git
   cd my_100_days_of_python_jouney
   git sparse-checkout set "Minor Projects/Day-16 OOp's Cofee Machine"
   ```
2. Navigate to the Minor Projects directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Minor Projects"
   ```
3. Navigate to the Day-16 OOp's Cofee Machine directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Day-16 OOp's Cofee Machine"
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üì¶ Features

- Serves three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino
- Checks if there are enough resources before serving
- Accepts coins and gives change if necessary
- Displays the remaining resources and money

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** - for implementing the logic
- **OOP** - for structuring the code

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `main.py` - The main file to run the coffee machine simulation
- `menu.py` - Contains the `Menu` and `MenuItem` classes
- `coffee_maker.py` - Contains the `CoffeeMaker` class
- `money_machine.py` - Contains the `MoneyMachine` class

## üí° Ideas for Improvement

- Add more coffee types and customization options.
- Implement input validation to handle incorrect inputs.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
