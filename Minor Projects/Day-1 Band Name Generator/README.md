# 🎸 Band Name Generator

A fun Python program that helps you come up with a unique band name based on the name of the city you grew up in and your pet's name. 

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-level Python program that takes two user inputs:
1. The name of the city you grew up in.
2. Your pet's name.

It then combines these inputs to generate a potential band name.

### Example:
```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> New York
What's your pet's name?
> Buddy
Your band name could be New York Buddy
```
