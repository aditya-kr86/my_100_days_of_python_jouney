# 🏆 Secret Auction

A simple Python program that simulates a secret auction where multiple bidders can anonymously submit their bids.

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that allows multiple users to enter bids secretly. The highest bidder wins the auction! The program continues until all users have finished entering their bids.

### Example:
```
Welcome to the Secret Auction!
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your bid: 200
Are there any other bidders? (yes/no): yes

Enter your name: Bob
Enter your bid: 300
Are there any other bidders? (yes/no): no

The winner is Bob with a bid of $300!
```
