# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game written in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that implements the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake, which grows longer as it eats food. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or itself.

### Example:
```
The game starts with a snake in the middle of the screen:
- The snake moves in the direction indicated by arrow keys.
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
The game ends if the snake collides with the screen border or itself.
```
