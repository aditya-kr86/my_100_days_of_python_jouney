# 📧 Mail Merge

A Python script to automatically generate personalized invitation letters using a mail merge technique!

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that allows you to generate personalized invitation letters for a list of recipients. The script reads the names of the recipients from a text file and merges them into a template letter to create individual invitation letters.

### Example:
```
The script reads names from "invited_names.txt" and merges each name into "starting_letter.txt" to create personalized invitation letters saved in the "Output" directory.
```
